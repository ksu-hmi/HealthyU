# Findings
* Able to open python files in VSC but unable to run successfully. Code in first few lines wants to import info from module but files are not found  on my computer ---- File "/Users/deboraho/Documents/HealthyU/Patient.py", line 2, in <module>from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
* Difficulty finding something even close to the code I'm looking for that is just Python

Other options
* https://github.com/mishal23/virtual-clinic.git-unable to use this, uses HTML and needs SQL also
* I could go back to the original repository code I had and download the preqreqs in order to see if the code can then work desppite it being another lanaguage OR find another code that just has simple alerts and make commits related to healthcare to match my personal project
* Installed PyQt5 and was able to get the main.py code file running
* downloaded SQLite to access database and inserted more data to reflect better when logging in
